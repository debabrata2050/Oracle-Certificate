## AI Basics

#### Which task is a Generative Al task?
- [ ] Detecting credit card fraud
- [x] Writing a poem based on a given theme ✅
- [ ] Identifying the main topic of a news article
- [ ] Calculating the total word count in an article

#### Which type of Machine Learning is used in autonomous car driving?
- [x] Reinforcement Learning ✅
- [ ] Natural Language Processing
- [ ] Unsupervised Learning
- [ ] Supervised Learning

> Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a branch of Machine Learning where an agent learns to perform actions in an environment to maximize a cumulative reward. In the context of autonomous car driving, the car is the agent, the road and its surroundings form the environment, and the reward might be related to safe and efficient navigation, obeying traffic rules, and reaching the desired destination.

#### Which is NOT an example of vision or image-related Al task?
- [ ] Facial recognition
- [ ] Identify objects in images
- [ ] Classify images
- [x] Repair damaged images ✅

> While image restoration and repair do involve working with images, it's not a typical vision task in the sense of identifying objects, classifying images, or facial recognition. While AI can certainly be used for image restoration, it's not one of the core tasks directly related to vision or image-related AI.

#### Which type of Machine Learning algorithms extracts trends from data?
- [x] Unsupervised Machine Learning ✅
- [ ] Natural Language Processing
- [ ] Reinforcement Learning
- [ ] Supervised Machine Learning

#### Which task is an example of a speech-related Al task?
- [x] Speech-to-text Conversion ✅
- [ ] Random number Generation
- [ ] Music Composition
- [ ] Language translation
