> Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a branch of Machine Learning where an agent learns to perform actions in an environment to maximize a cumulative reward. In the context of autonomous car driving, the car is the agent, the road and its surroundings form the environment, and the reward might be related to safe and efficient navigation, obeying traffic rules, and reaching the desired destination.

#### Which is NOT an example of vision or image-related Al task?
- [ ] Facial recognition
- [ ] Identify objects in images
- [ ] Classify images
- [x] Repair damaged images ✅

> While image restoration and repair do involve working with images, it's not a typical vision task in the sense of identifying objects, classifying images, or facial recognition. While AI can certainly be used for image restoration, it's not one of the core tasks directly related to vision or image-related AI.

## DL Basics

#### Which type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architecture is used for Machine Translation?
- [ ] Many-to-One
- [ ] One-to-One
- [ ] One-to-Many
- [x] Many-to-Many ✅

> Machine Translation involves translating a sentence or a sequence of text from one language to another, which is essentially a sequence-to-sequence problem. In Many-to-Many RNN architecture, the network takes a sequence of inputs and produces a sequence of outputs. In the context of machine translation, this means it can take a sequence of words or tokens in one language as input and generate a corresponding sequence of words or tokens in another language as output.

#### Which sequence model can maintain relevant information over long sequences?
- [ ] Recurrent Neural Networks
- [ ] Convolutional Neural Networks
- [x] Long Short-Term Memory Neural Networks ✅
- [ ] Feed Forward Neural Networks

> Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Neural Networks are the sequence model of choice when it comes to handling and maintaining relevant information over long sequences, making them particularly well-suited for tasks like language modeling, machine translation, and speech recognition.

#### Which Neural Network has a feedback loop and is designed to handle sequential data?
- [ ] Multi-Layer Perceptron Neural Networks
- [ ] Convolution Neural Networks
- [ ] Feed Forward Neural Networks
- [x] Recurrent Neural Networks ✅

#### Which essential component of Artificial Neural Network performs weighted summation and applies activation function on input data to produce an output?
- [ ] Classifier
- [ ] Bias
- [x] Neuron ✅
- [ ] Iterator

- [ ] Directly mapping input characters to output predictions
- [ ] Improving the interpretability of the model s decisions
- [ ] Increasing the network's processing speed
- [x] Enabling the network to learn complex features like edges and shapes ✅

> Hidden layers in neural networks are crucial for character recognition because they enable the network to learn and extract complex features and patterns, such as edges, shapes, and curves, which are essential for recognizing characters.

> The size and complexity of a language model, including the number of parameters (weights) and tokens have a profound impact on its capabilities and performance. Larger models with more parameters tend to have a better understanding of language and can generate more coherent and contextually relevant text. Larger models, however, require substantial computational resources, including GPUs and memory, for both training and inference.
